# 🔄 Basics of RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The **RAG pipeline** is a method that improves how AI models answer questions by combining two steps:
- **Retrieval** (fetching information)
- **Generation** (creating answers)

This simple combo makes AI systems more accurate and up-to-date.

## 🚀 Simple Explanation: How RAG Pipeline Works

Think of it like this:

1. **You ask a question** 🗣️  
   ➡️ *"What is RAG in AI?"*

2. **Retriever searches documents** 🔍  
   ➡️ Finds the top 3-5 documents or text chunks related to your question from a knowledge base.

3. **Combine the question + documents** 🧩  
   ➡️ The system puts your question and the retrieved texts together as one input.

4. **Generator creates the answer** ✨  
   ➡️ A language model reads everything and writes a clear, natural answer.

## 🛠️ RAG Pipeline - Step by Step

| Step              | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Query Input**  | User submits a question or prompt           |
| **2. Document Retrieval** | Retriever finds relevant documents from a database |
| **3. Context Augmentation** | Retrieved docs are combined with the user’s question |
| **4. Text Generation** | Generator model creates the final answer |
