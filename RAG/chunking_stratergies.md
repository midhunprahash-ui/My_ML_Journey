# Document Chunking Strategies in RAG

## Introduction
Document chunking is a critical component in RAG systems that involves breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces for effective processing and retrieval.

## Chunking Methods
1. Fixed Size Chunking
   - Character-based chunks
   - Token-based chunks
   - Sentence-based chunks

2. Semantic Chunking
   - Paragraph-based
   - Section-based
   - Topic-based

## Best Practices
- Optimal chunk sizes
- Overlap strategies
- Metadata preservation
- Context retention
