# Introduction to NumPy

## ðŸ“Œ Basic Concepts
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides:
- Multi-dimensional array objects
- Various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices)
- An assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays

### Core Concept: The NumPy Array
The basic object in NumPy is the homogeneous multidimensional array:
- It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type
- The dimensions are called axes
- The number of axes is called rank

## ðŸ“Œ Installation
### Using pip
```bash
pip install numpy
